Problems Faced during Embedded C Programming:
1.While using Switch, Not initialized Pull-Up resistor (PUPDR) 
	a.The switch will not work
2.Switch not working
	a.Clock is not initialized [RCC_AHB1ENR] for PORT-C But the Switch is Enabled in PORT-C.
	b.Enabling the wrong port number for the desired switch.
3.Particular port not enabling
	a.Calculating Physical Address is wrong.
4.Debug window in Keil select Correct Hardware device [ST-link debug] and its frequency [16 MHz ].
5.Facing a loading problem 
	a.Enable the Reset and Run option in Flash download settings in the Debug window
	b.In Trace change the core frequency to 16-MHz (default frequency).
	c.In the Debug window of the Cortex-M target Driver setup the port must be selected as SW (serial wire debugger) or (JTAG) based on your debugging device.
	d.In the flash download tab if the device is removed from the programming algorithm add the device.

6.Assigning 32-bit address as 8-digit hex number[0x12345678] but  giving 7-digit [0x1234567] or 9-hexa number[0x123456789] is not wrong but some conditions it fails.
7.Assuming the wrong Bus when the time of enabling clock.
8.While defining Addresses use type casting like *(int*) for a 32-bit system. If you miss the typecasting, you will get the following error.
	a.#define RCC_AHB1ENR     0x40023830 //physical address of RCC_AHB1ENR (Type casting missed)
	b.Giving space in between the 32-bit address also gives the following error.  
	c.#define RCC_AHB1ENR    *(int*)  0x4002_3830 //Don’t give space in between address
	d.#define RCC_AHB1ENR    *(int*)  0x40023830 ;//Don’t place semicolon after macro
	e.RCC_AHB1ENR |=( 0x1<<1); //when we try to use this 
	f.Error: Expression not assignable
9.When hardcoded hexadecimal numbers are used don’t use the tilt symbol in clearing particular bit fields.
	a.SYSCFG_EXTICR3 &  = ~  (0xFFFFFF00);
10.Pick the correct External interrupt handler name in the source code.
	a.EXTI9_5_IRQHandler [for 8 and 9 interrupts]
	b.If we place another IRQHandler like EXTI15_10_IRQHandler [ for 8 and 9], an External interrupt will not work when we press the switch.
11.error: declaration may not appear after an executable statement in a block
	a.int remaining _Len = Len - i;  //Here declared the variable inside the for loop 
	b.Declare before the Block
12.Problem: Automatic triggering problem inside ADC IRQ Handler when we placed breakpoint. 
a.Don’t Configure External interrupt inside while loop.
i.while(1)
	{
	ADC_CR2 |=0x20000000;//set 29,28th bit EXTEN as Falling edge
		ADC_CR2 |=(0xF<<24);//enable EXTEL
    }
	b.Configuration must be only one time. Place the configuration outside of the loop.
13.Printing garbage strings on LCD
	a.Write_data function in LCD loop infinite.
	b.Writing proper conditions to get out of the loop after printing.
14.Problem : Proper delay not coming when we used Hardware SYSTICK TIMER when printing ON LCD.
	a.First initialize the SysTICK timer before LCD_init( ).
15.Problem :Data not printing on LCD
	a.Clock not initialized for PORT-B, and selecting ODR of PORT-B as OUTPUT. 
	b.First initialize the clock.
16.Problem: Getting the same values in two ADC channels.
	a.Selecting the same channels in PORT-C[PC0,PC1]
	b.Loading sequential register values wrong
17.Problem: Response not coming in Dock light
	a.Check array size of buffer [buffer[i]=USART_DR;]
	b.Baud rate in dock light
18.Problem: Response not coming in Dock light after AT_RST
	a.Check delay for Reset command and Systick timer delay
